Python wrappers for GCO alpha-expansion and alpha-beta-swaps.
These wrappers provide a high level interface for graph cut
inference for multi-label problems.

See my blog for examples and comments: [peekaboo-vision.blogspot.com](https://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.com)



Installation
------------

With Pip
--------
- Run `pip install git+git://github.com/amueller/gco_python`

For Linux
---------
- Download and install Cython (use your package manager).

- run ``make``

- Run example.py for a simple example.


For Windows
-----------
- Make sure Cython is installed (included in enthought Python distribution for example)

- Download original source from http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/gco-v3.0.zip

- Build gco with your compiler of choice. Create a dynamic library at libgco.so.

- Adjust the path to gco in setup.py.

- run ``python setup.py build``.

- run example.py for a simple example.


Troubleshooting
---------------
There have been some problems compiling gco (not my wrappers) using gcc4.7.
Please install gcc-4.6 and adjust the call in Makefile accordingly.


Usage
-----
GCO implements alpha expansion and alpha beta swaps using graphcuts.
These can be used to efficiently find low energy configurations of certain energy functions.
Note that from a probabilistic viewpoint, GCO works in log-space.

Note that all input arrays are assumed to be in int32.
This means that float potentials must be rounded!

These algorithms can only deal with certain energies. Unfortunately
I have not figured out yet how to convert C++ errors to Python. If an unknown
error is raised, it probably means that you used an invalid energy function.
Look at the gco README for details.

This package gives a high level interface to gco, providing the following functions:

``cut_simple``:
    Graph cut on a 2D grid using a global label affinity-matrix.

``cut_VH``:
    NOT DONE YET
    Graph cut on a 2D grid using a global label affinity-matrix and edge-weights.
    ``V`` contains the weights for vertical edges, ``H`` for horizontal ones.

``cut_from_graph``:
    Graph cut on an arbitrary graph with global label affinity-matrix.

``cut_from_graph_weighted``:
    NOT DONE YET
    Graph cut on an arbitrary graph with global label affinity-matrix and
    edgeweights.

See ``example.py`` and ``example_middlebury.py`` for examples and the gco README
for more details.
